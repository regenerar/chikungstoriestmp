# Chi Kung Stories Blog

This is a old project that I've been working on it uses the knowledge that I used in other blogs. 

+ It is ultra ligh 
+ Atom compatible
+ It has a archive option devided by years 

and I'm working on using it to podcast my files.

Fell free to use the code.

I'm not a coder so some routines may seem quite dumb, I also accept sugestions.
