&lt;p&gt;Basic sequence exploring the effortless way of training and how being in the posture is different from holding the posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing this to your days, you may find out when you are tired that maybe you are holding a posture or a mindset instead of being in a posture or in the mindset. It’s Rigidity Vs Adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t see the vídeo? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/vm5vN_TiqDU&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to connect with Earth - by connecting to it - no bullshit or rhetorical mambo jumbo, just squat, sit, lay on the ground and feel beyond everything you knew before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better experience - &lt;a href=&quot;http://truecenterpublishing.com/zenstory/emptycup.html&quot;&gt;please empty your cup at the door.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 90 minutes, I filmed myself working with a box/squatting desk. This became a 90 second video of possibilities, that you can engage while on the floor working.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is too hard, don’t be too harsh - use your creativity with a pillow or a mat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When stillness has to be payed</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Black hole resorts, is one of the new concepts of health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These resorts, sell the experience that while there, you can’t access mobile phone, internet or television. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total disconnection - that may go beyond the 2000 Euros/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value, “allows the privilege” of being in a place where there is no access to any of these devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It acts like a detox, for those who can’t - at home, take this decision by themselves in a conscious way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disconnection, can be the fine line between losing or conquering autonomy on your everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss or gain of empowerment, before the freedom that humans have - to embrace stillness by themselves - consciously, where ever they may roam.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world it’s not lost, humanity either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only to be recovered the habit, by saying yes or no - to establish limits, to the most challenging human being on this planet - ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pills of many colors, all aligned - like a little army, all with specific functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lower the blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve blood circulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keep the cholesterol levels healthy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keep diabetes stable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;protect the stomach &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;balance some endocrine system like the thyroid &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anti-inflammatory functions &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the bowel movement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who already had the opportunity, to observe the breakfast of a person who had chosen a healthier approach to life, could have found this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packs and bottles of healthy pills and colorful powders, aligned with specific functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a powder to detoxify&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a powder rich in protein&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a powder for vitality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a powder that stimulates the mental activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seeds to boost the energy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;berries who are anti-oxidant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pill with dozens of vitamins and minerals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything mixed in a juice or water, with some healthy sugar that guaranties energy for all morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” is still true today has it was more than 2000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a challenge anymore, finding the right food for a specific unbalance, but to draw a clear line where the food stops to be a medicine to be crutch that creates addiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As powerful or even more than the chemical substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How does the cow catches the rabbit?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, I’ve been traveling to Amsterdam at least twice a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason to travel, has been to deepen my studies about Chi Kung. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times, I stay at friends homes, which besides having a place to sleep and to cook my food, it also enables me to know better some of the dutch traditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects of the cultures that I take in high esteem, is the traditional expressions that justify or help us solve inner doubts or struggles in our lives. It looks like in the past, this also happened countless times. This also gives me the sense of the whole I live in. Everything is connected.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the expressions, that I learned in Amsterdam, has some part of cartoon and intriguing feeling when I heard it for the first time: - “How does the cow catches the rabbit?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expression, has the characteristics of a Zen Koan and it’s used on a context - when there is something quite challenging to do, but you just can’t figure it out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is always a way the cow can catch the rabbit” - said my teacher once to me, regarding some question about starting to teach in Portugal, “you just have to figure it out how.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a good koan, the solution is not related with formulas or a theoretical advice - it is solved according to your own resources, according to your own identity.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, everyone who tries to produce meaningful work finds this question every day - How does the cow catches the rabbit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this koan every day on may Chi Kung training - how to keep it simple and effective? But I guess, it’s the same for everyone who writes, paints, sings, raises a family or embraces some other activity, that he can define as artistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is I guess, if every day you exercise the cow, she will get a bit better as the time goes along. She can learn the tricks of the rabbit, and do what is - according to the laws of physics and in our own minds, an event quite unique to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today, how does the cow catches the rabbit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000 and during the following six years, I studied with a Chinese Chi Kung Master. His approach, was the use of a practice called Zhan Zhuang (站樁). You can roughly translate it as “Standing like a pole”. Also known, as standing like a tree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practice, asks you to stand for some time, with your feet at shoulder width, the arms are resting at the sides of the body or in some posture at the back, front or sides of the torso. It’s also called by some schools standing zen meditation. The time of practice, can go from 1 minute to the time that you wish. More seasoned practitioners of this art, can spend from 40 to 90 minutes every day, cultivating in this way stillness and awareness of the body/mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his workshops, Master Li would emphasized this practice and we would spend at least one hour standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people, in the end of the training, those new to this concept, would ask him questions regarding to feelings and sensations during the practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer of Master Li was unanimous, sometimes with a smile, sometime with a laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s very good!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why did I felt tension in my shoulders?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why did I felt tingling in my fingers?” &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why did I saw some blue lights?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why I had trouble to stay still and I felt bored?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“why do my feet hurt?”
…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would answer: “You felt ………? that’s very good!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start to practice, many sensations may arise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make a list of the few most common, but there are some that always come off the norm. Some that you can’t find anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the nature of the Chi of the human body, it’s personal and can not be putted in a box - can’t be tagged or classified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chi expresses your unique identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the times that we live, copy and paste is a norm, you can make copies of everything, making everything look similar and standardized. Chi Kung still stands as a manifest, where the individual is more important then the sensations, schools or forms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about what YOU feel, not about if it is in the norm or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s all very good!”*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*When in doubt, if there are sensations which persist and become uncomfortable ask to experienced teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“When it rained I would still go out and run. Because I didn’t knew how many days the rain would last. I couldn’t afford myself to the luxury that if the rain would last five days I wouldn’t practice during all these days”  - A casual conversation with a retired professional runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chi Kung practice also faces rainy days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can get sick and it can last for two days, a week, or even more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends and family come to visit you and stay under your roof, for an unexpected number of days .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The workload rises and you can’t  predict when it will gonna slow down again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expected or unexpected travel, can disrupt the practice routine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical or emotional trauma, can take away space and reduce in some cases drastically the time and resources that you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This events, like the rainy days, make it unpredictable when will be again space and time for your training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in doubt - practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the time, space and resources are different from the usual ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace the challenge of these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can overcome and endure the rainy days, when the sun shines again, your practice will be more strong and integrated, no matter what’s the inner or outer  weather report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It is not enough to be busy. So are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?” - Henry David Thoreau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you recognize that the Chi Kung practice can add some value to your life its common that you may ask yourself how can this practice happen on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges are related to find space in your agenda, and it can be that this agenda could be full regarding other matters, most of all not related to the use of the time in a qualitative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This invites you to a question, when this agenda takes over and you become more like a “human doing” instead of a human being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do I want to live the life of this busy agenda or be free to choose at least 20 minutes every day to experience the freedom of My agenda?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer nobody can give you better than yourself, in an honest and direct way, making use of all your potentials and limitations regarding your time, your space and resources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, making your practice happen right after every time you reflect upon this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Measuring the quality of space in your day</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2003, during a visit to a museum in the city of Nanjing in China, I could observe three men selecting paintings for an exhibition that would happen later in that afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was amazed by the selection process. It was quite fast and most of the times without words. Some nodding between them, or some sound was sufficient for a painting to be selected or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I understood that it’s not about the fish, the nature scene or the historical personality that is painted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about how the space is used and how it fuses with the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being an expert, I guess this simplifies a lot of the process of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lest it looked so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out, that this process, can be also accurate and helpful when looking back to my doings at end of a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of remembering the things I’ve achieved, as a measure of how successful my day was, it’s easier - and more confronting too, if I just look for the quality of space and time in this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I can do it so fast as those Chinese juries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the amount of this space and time in your daily Chi Kung practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does stillness have a place in it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are your practice full of forms? Is it spontaneity allowed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s more a doing or a being?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I invite you today for an exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think in a place that you wouldn’t like to be right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe stuck in the traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe doing something that you don’t like at work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe being in someones’s company that you don’t appreciate so much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe you have to be on a waiting line to fill and give out a form to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe on a job interview that will happen this week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe at the dentist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe at the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe sick in your own bed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe in crowded places when you would prefer to be alone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe alone when you would enjoy to have someone by your side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these could be the last places where you would like to be right now, if you find yourself in these environments you can give yourself a deep breath, a smile and discover that your Chi Kung practice can flourish in the most unlikely places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A traditional Tai Chi Form can take up to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Chi Kung practices can take the student on a journey for more than an hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung (站樁氣功) postures would be practiced for at least 40 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would you invest your precious time everyday, sometimes more than once a day in this practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entrance door for most of the students are the effects it brings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effects can be speculated in a more physical or esoteric way. This can lead to never ending chats at the fireplace or in internet forums, just by the uselessness of trying to prove what that can only be perceived by regular and consistent practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the music world there is an expression: “Shut up and listen!” when things go far beyond the theoretical realm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you to disconnect and ground yourself on your sacred space and forget all the promises and wonders that every system encloses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next 20, 30 or 40 minutes just “Shut up and practice!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s. - And please don’t tell anyone about this. In doing it you are wasting precious silence for what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joseph Pilates, Nelson Mandela and Guo Yunshen</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Pilates, creator of the Pilates Method was placed by the British government during the First World War in a detention camp. There, he applied is knowledge to strengthen the body in the form of exercises, not only just for himself but for the other detainees that where with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in this setup gave him the opportunity to refine and develop exercises that  needed very little or no materials. In this way, he enriched his technique that is now used worldwide as a health and fitness method.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now known that Nelson Mandela when he was incarcerated raced every day in his cell 45 minutes in the same place. It was followed by 200 abdominal crunches and 100 pushups in his fingertips to keep himself fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century Guo Yunshen - the master of Wang Xiang Zhai which created the lineage I represent, was detained in jail for three years. His arrest included two iron balls attached to his legs that prevented him from walking or moving freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His training consisted during those three years in addition to various stationary postures the practice and improvement of a martial technique known as “half-step”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step, when mastered results in very strong punch that can be ignited in a very short distance - similar to Bruce Lee’s “one inch punch”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was released, his health had improved substantially - he was healthier then when he got in, and his “half-step” became known as something “that couldn’t be defeated by anyone under Heaven”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your decision to practice or not to practice today is separated by a fine line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rarely you should point this decision to external circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letting external to rule your internal disposition only postpones another day of practice - most of the times makes you feel miserable too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a wonderful excuse for various engagements, but serves no one, much less your development and purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-4&quot;&gt;5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before you blame the weather, the politics, the world crises, the pile of work to be done and how this make you feel sad and down, just do a thing first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your ass off the chair and do some practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t guarantee you that all your worries will be gone after that, but I can guarantee you that at least this may happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You proved yourself that no matter what, training is possible and it’s not about them is about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing this you also reclaimed your freedom like Joseph Pilates, Nelson Mandela or Guo Yunshen once did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, do it again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a wonderful week of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chi Kung Myths - Part one</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chi Kung arrived to the West in a more consistent way in the early eighties, since then it’s become part of the daily routine of an increasing number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually has it became available in books, movies and other formats and it gave rise to some kind of mystical cloud around this practice. Mostly by people who saw, read, but never tried themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myths were then born about Chi Kung, about his range of action as a therapeutic, religious or even martial art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a few articles which I called Chi Kung Urban Myths and this is the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth number one - Chi Kung it’s mainly for old and sick people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea was born when the first footage’s were starting to arrive from China showing the parks or the hospitals full of happy people doing exercises. The main characters in those movies were most aged people or sick people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that stroked the western mind was that it looked like something that was being almost done in a no gravity environment resembling the first expedition to the moon. This effortless and easy characteristic of these movements gave rise to the idea: “This is a low impact exercise and it looks quite relaxing and easy, let’s teach this to people that are retired or are in a low energy state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess the first transplants of this art, made by the pioneers who had the courage to step out and teach them - mainly to people who neither the mind or body heard or dreamed of it, was quite challenging for both parts.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same with people who are ill and they didn’t had time enjoy the benefits of this practice when they were healthy in order to develop some kind of trust relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is this: In the videos from the 80’s we watch the end of the line. Which means that those lovely elderly people who do it effortlessly have been doing that for years maybe throughout their lives. Most of the cases 40 or 50 years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospitals we see using Chi Kung they have patients who have practiced during their lives or have heard of it in a way that they can trust as a therapy. It’s in their culture for at least 3000 years - I guess that’s a good point to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that seniors could not benefit from it. I taught two classes a week for more than 10 years to elderly practitioners and the benefits were amazing. Some of my students nowadays have more than 65 and really enjoy and reap benefits from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it can be taught to relieve or prevent chronic and acute unbalances in a way that most of the therapies struggle to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a very limited scope of action when the Chi is everywhere in our lives and the Chi Kung practice can be used to enhance the qualities of that Chi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that everyone can benefit from it. In the older people it can help them to stay connected with their youth and get both longevity and quality of life. In younger people it can help them to focus their energy on what is important and constructive. Even in children it can help them to discover their bodies and surroundings in a natural and healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now growing the number of researches using Chi Kung - mainly regarding to diseases. I guess it’s important, but this promotes even more this myth as an approach only useful for sick people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ourselves in the daily practice, we can learn that doing it while healthy, it’s more efficient than when the sickness creeps in and sooner we start to train in a regular way sooner we understand that it can turn out as one of the most important savings accounts for the days in the future, if we wish to create quality in our lives towards longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s. For a deep understanding of it’s contemporary story I recommend the David’s Palmer book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bookdepository.com/Qigong-Fever-David-Palmer/9780231140669&quot;&gt;Qigong Fever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The sum of all parts</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my teens Carl Sagan’s Cosmos was for me a window to knowledge otherwise difficult to access in the small village where I grew up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the episodes he gathers the main constituents of the human body and mix them all together. The result was dark and smoky water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example that what we are and do are far more then the sum of several parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think in my Chi Kung training I can see it as pieces that glue together designed to have a specific effect, or something more vast and wide which is not just the exercises but everything since the environment, the preparation, the food, mental state, season and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of it is that when I relax and accept all this interferences and relations it’s more easy to feel supported and also healed by this practice and I guess also by life itself too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view for the first time or remember it - Carl Sagan’s video on chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Formality in the practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are invited to a party where you don’t know most of the people and there is a strict dress code the feeling is different from a beach party where you know everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the later you get a relaxed sensation, you may don’t want to leave the party and the question is: “can I stay just a bit more?”. In a conventional and formal event the question would be more like “when can I leave?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you stroll on the daily routine of exercises, it´s easy to get formal and this means to transform your training into a checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that happens the benefits of the training may just fade and tension builds up more and more as you go along. Because you must do and perform instead of just show up and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the training should be something without structure or goal which is essential to a consistent routine, but both of the approaches can bring benefits to the practice instead of just choosing one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are just “the check list freak” with always so many things to practice and so little time to do them, once a week choose doing the three most relaxing exercises that you are fond of. Do less to achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are just “the beach party Chi Kung student” once a week sit five minutes before you start, take note of a few exercises that you would like to do and make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to use both mindsets as tools that can benefit your training, bringing more awareness of your tensions and ability to relax them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formality can block, but also shapes the Chi, informality can make it quite blurry, but also can be a wonderful relaxing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Sacred and the Unholy</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the image: several Buddhas, Holly Marie statues, Santa Theresa D’Avila, golden angels, Milo’s Venus and a priest with a dog’s head&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since more then 20 journeys ago I elected Amsterdam as one of the most powerful places for developing my Chi Kung Training and one of my second homes in the planet besides Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What attracts me here it’s the combination between the sacred and the unholy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common to sense the smell of cannabis in almost every corner or you can find a Buddhist temple just in the vicinities of a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Red Light district one of the most truistic places in town, sex shops and churches from several religions live in what looks as a perfect harmony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after all what does this has to do with the Practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out that if you can transform the contrasts and antagonisms in something nourishing, you can find your three square meters for your practice anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Buddha in the center of the city (Amsterdam, June 2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Sacred Place is where it’s possible to disconnect and create a panoramic view from your daily affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Sacred Place can be created using three main ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ritual &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contemplation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disconnection it’s not only about switching off the mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s choosing that you don’t speak about work or surf the social networks at the table or in the bedroom. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the car, you don’t switch on the radio, or at home, you don’t switch on the TV just to “keep you company”. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In those moments you have to wait, you don’t jump to your mobile phone to see if you have a new SMS or email every time you encounter silence or boredom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disconnection creates the ability to choose the space and importance that the world can have in our lives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ritual doesn’t have to do just with religious ceremonies, but also with actions in a certain sequence that lead to a bigger purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s cleaning the kitchen and get the utensils ready before you start cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s burning an incense stick  before your Chi Kung practice or meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s cleaning the desk before starting to write, paint, draw or answering emails.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s putting on some comfortable clothes and relax in the first 10 minutes after you arrive home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemplation it’s the opposite from focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you observe a tree, you don’t see only the tree. Observe the shape, the texture of the trunk, the color of the leaves and how they move with the wind. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the seaside you listen to the sound of the waves, you feel the wind on your face and the salty smell that it brings. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You look forward at the horizon and not down while walking in the city. Walk slowly and in a conscious way without judging the images, the sounds and the smells. Let it all be as it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a meal you feel the food that you chew and the different tastes, smells and even memories that it brings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can travel to a distant country in search of a sacred place, but you can also learn to recognize these three ingredients in the places and moments that make part of your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they are found and cultivated these places bring time, space and resources, so wherever you may roam, you can be aware not only of the present moment, but also the sacred that these moments have to offer at every step of your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What's the profile of a Chi Kung student?</title>
    <published>2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</published>

  &lt;p&gt;“It (what you choose to do) has got to be something that you’re passionate about because otherwise you won’t have the perseverance to see it through.” - Jobs, the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I teach Chi Kung since 1998 and during this time period I had many people in my classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In weekly classes, workshops, events, or briefly in the treatment room where I prescribe a exercise to support the healing of a certain condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that I ask myself often is what makes a student after a first contact with this art come back… or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the profile of the Chi Kung student?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes someone to invest 10 years of is life studying and practicing? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reasons I guess are connected with what the practice has to offer to each and every one of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I believe that there is more then this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my students I can identify at least five traits that can make
a difference in the challenges that this art brings once you start practicing
it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They practice for health reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; They found out in this practice a way of understanding some chronic issue and by this understanding they can cope with it in a fresh new vision about what are the causes of they’re suffering. The unbalances range from pain, digestive problems, immune system disorders, sleep problems and others that don’t have any name but diminish their quality of life. It doesn’t matter if a pain in the shoulder is more challenging then the inability to sleep. The most important is that there is a will in each of them to do something in their benefit and a commitment to follow this path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are curious.&lt;/strong&gt; They ask questions. There is a thirst to know more. Not just &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; but a knowledge that can better explain what they practice. In this way they keep the motivation alive as the training progresses and they find challenges to be taken. I speak also for myself in this subject. I live 2000 km from my teacher. Know how to research about a subject and search for the various perspectives of the same view is also a way to keep myself motivated. Like in life one of the indicators that can increase longevity is curiosity and the need to know more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are not afraid to make mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s possible to reap many benefits from Chi Kung in a weekly class. But you can increase them if you build your own practice. In a survey that I did in 2013, among the reasons why that they don’t practice at home is that they don’t know what to practice when they are by themselves. In some cases you can translate this also to “I want to practice but I’m afraid to make mistakes.” The main difference between this students and others who practice is that the ones who practice understood that by overcoming fear of failure create questions. This questions once clarified by me or in a conversation with a fellow student put’s them in the “right track” and makes them go even further. This trait also shows how each one accept error and mistake as hindrance or as one of the most powerful tools for growing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They practice the child’s mind concept.&lt;/strong&gt; This kind of mentality is focused in the process, not in it’s completion. A child can play with a toy for weeks or months with the same gadget, with the same setup. The difference is the story that is created each time around the toy that helps her to really enjoy the moment. The goal of Chi Kung it’s not to know many exercises, but to embrace the challenge of how deeply we understand the material that we already have to fit our present condition. There is no goal, just a path open to discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are time wise.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two types of training the formal way that is possible to do at home or at the park and the informal one where you take the practice wherever you are. Both ways are valid to develop your Chi. To be time wise requires to make use of the daily affairs to practice. It’s possible to practice when you are sited in a bus, waiting for the train to come or as you walk on the street. To be able to recognize this situations as training opportunities can enable you to train your posture and awareness most part of the day. To develop a consistent and regular training asks for choices how to spend the time that is given to us. We can spend more 15 minutes surfing in the internet or use this time to practice. It depends of the priorities we establish to ourselves. I can take this choices as the importance that anyone gives to oneself and his development. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to know if you are a student how this article resonates with you? How do you create motivation in your training?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a teacher do you recognize this traits on your students? What’s for you the profile of your students? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your practice!&lt;/p&gt;
