	<h2>How does the cow catches the rabbit?</h2>

</article>

<p>Since 2004, I’ve been traveling to Amsterdam at least twice a year. </p>

<p>The main reason to travel, has been to deepen my studies about Chi Kung. </p>

<p>Most of the times, I stay at friends homes, which besides having a place to sleep and to cook my food, it also enables me to know better some of the dutch traditions. </p>

<p>One of the aspects of the cultures that I take in high esteem, is the traditional expressions that justify or help us solve inner doubts or struggles in our lives. It looks like in the past, this also happened countless times. This also gives me the sense of the whole I live in. Everything is connected.  </p>

<p>One of the expressions, that I learned in Amsterdam, has some part of cartoon and intriguing feeling when I heard it for the first time: - “How does the cow catches the rabbit?”</p>

<p>This expression, has the characteristics of a Zen Koan and it’s used on a context - when there is something quite challenging to do, but you just can’t figure it out how to do it.</p>

<p>“There is always a way the cow can catch the rabbit” - said my teacher once to me, regarding some question about starting to teach in Portugal, “you just have to figure it out how.”</p>

<p>As a good koan, the solution is not related with formulas or a theoretical advice - it is solved according to your own resources, according to your own identity.   </p>

<p>I guess, everyone who tries to produce meaningful work finds this question every day - How does the cow catches the rabbit?</p>

<p>I find this koan every day on may Chi Kung training - how to keep it simple and effective? But I guess, it’s the same for everyone who writes, paints, sings, raises a family or embraces some other activity, that he can define as artistic.</p>

<p>The trick is I guess, if every day you exercise the cow, she will get a bit better as the time goes along. She can learn the tricks of the rabbit, and do what is - according to the laws of physics and in our own minds, an event quite unique to happen. </p>

<p>So, today, how does the cow catches the rabbit?</p>

<p>Enjoy your practice. </p>
