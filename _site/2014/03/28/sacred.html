<p>A Sacred Place is where it’s possible to disconnect and create a panoramic view from your daily affairs.</p>

<p>A Sacred Place can be created using three main ingredients.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disconnection</li>
  <li>Ritual </li>
  <li>Contemplation</li>
</ul>

<p>Disconnection it’s not only about switching off the mobile phone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s choosing that you don’t speak about work or surf the social networks at the table or in the bedroom. </li>
  <li>In the car, you don’t switch on the radio, or at home, you don’t switch on the TV just to “keep you company”. </li>
  <li>In those moments you have to wait, you don’t jump to your mobile phone to see if you have a new SMS or email every time you encounter silence or boredom.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disconnection creates the ability to choose the space and importance that the world can have in our lives</p>

<p>Ritual doesn’t have to do just with religious ceremonies, but also with actions in a certain sequence that lead to a bigger purpose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s cleaning the kitchen and get the utensils ready before you start cooking.</li>
  <li>It’s burning an incense stick  before your Chi Kung practice or meditation.</li>
  <li>It’s cleaning the desk before starting to write, paint, draw or answering emails.</li>
  <li>It’s putting on some comfortable clothes and relax in the first 10 minutes after you arrive home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contemplation it’s the opposite from focus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you observe a tree, you don’t see only the tree. Observe the shape, the texture of the trunk, the color of the leaves and how they move with the wind. </li>
  <li>At the seaside you listen to the sound of the waves, you feel the wind on your face and the salty smell that it brings. </li>
  <li>You look forward at the horizon and not down while walking in the city. Walk slowly and in a conscious way without judging the images, the sounds and the smells. Let it all be as it is.</li>
  <li>At a meal you feel the food that you chew and the different tastes, smells and even memories that it brings.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can travel to a distant country in search of a sacred place, but you can also learn to recognize these three ingredients in the places and moments that make part of your day.</p>

<p>Once they are found and cultivated these places bring time, space and resources, so wherever you may roam, you can be aware not only of the present moment, but also the sacred that these moments have to offer at every step of your way.</p>

<p>Enjoy your practice.</p>
