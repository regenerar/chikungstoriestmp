	<h2>Measuring the quality of space in your day</h2>
</header>

<article> 
 
</article>

<p>In 2003, during a visit to a museum in the city of Nanjing in China, I could observe three men selecting paintings for an exhibition that would happen later in that afternoon.</p>

<p>I was amazed by the selection process. It was quite fast and most of the times without words. Some nodding between them, or some sound was sufficient for a painting to be selected or not.</p>

<p>A few months later, I understood that it’s not about the fish, the nature scene or the historical personality that is painted. </p>

<p>It’s about how the space is used and how it fuses with the whole.</p>

<p>Without being an expert, I guess this simplifies a lot of the process of choice.</p>

<p>At lest it looked so.</p>

<p>I found out, that this process, can be also accurate and helpful when looking back to my doings at end of a day.</p>

<p>Instead of remembering the things I’ve achieved, as a measure of how successful my day was, it’s easier - and more confronting too, if I just look for the quality of space and time in this day.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I can do it so fast as those Chinese juries.</p>

<p>What is the amount of this space and time in your daily Chi Kung practice?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does stillness have a place in it?</li>
  <li>Are your practice full of forms? Is it spontaneity allowed?</li>
  <li>It’s more a doing or a being?</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy your practice.</p>
