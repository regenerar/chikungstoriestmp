## About

<p><img src="/images/foto.jpg" class="profile" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.1em; width: 250px;"></p>

My name is Lourenço de Azevedo,

Since 1998, I&#8217;ve embraced the study of the subject of stillness and efforless movement, along with my Chinese Medical Studies.

I practice and teach Standing Chi Kung known in China as Zhan Zhuang (Pronounces as Jam Jong).

I believe that more important then all the theory that can be present in a class, the core challenge for me has a teacher is to create consistency, effectiveness and autonomy in the practice of those who seek my classes.

I live and teach in Lisbon, Portugal.

This blog contains original and translated texts from a blog I host in Portuguese since 2008 &#8211; [Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung &#8211; A Arte do Cultivo da Quietude ](http://lourencoazevedo.com)
