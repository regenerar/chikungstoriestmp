# Chi Kung Stories Blog

This is a old project that I've been working on it uses the knowledge that I used in other blogs. 

+ It is ultra ligh 
+ It has a archive option divided by years 
+ Xml file improved - can get the pictures from the blog to mailchimp - [thanks to this article](http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/posts/add-image-to-jekyll-posts-rss-feed/) 


Fell free to use the code.

I'm not a coder so some routines may seem quite dumb, I also accept sugestions.
