Leaning to value your energy can be a possible keyword.

**Recipe for dry cough porridge**

+ 2/3 Rice flakes
+ 1/3 Millet flakes
+ 1 sliced pear - with or without skin
+ pinch of salt

Cook in 3 times the amount of water for 20 minutes.

**Suggestion:** You can cook it also using sugarless oat drink, instead of water.

Keep stirring once a while so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. 

Savor it warm. 

Enjoy your practice and happy sky gazing.
