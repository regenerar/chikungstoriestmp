As my classes are finishing for this year, I talk about the theme os study from this trimester that is ending - Nourishment.

What does it mean to be nourished and the idea of the whole. 

[I talk in the podcast about this text by Thich Nhat Han](http://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=222).


Enjoy your practice and happy sky gazing.
