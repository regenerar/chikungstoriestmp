>"It is not enough to be busy. So are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?" - Henry David Thoreau

When you recognize that the Chi Kung practice can add some value to your life its common that you may ask yourself how can this practice happen on a daily basis.

Some of the challenges are related to find space in your agenda, and it can be that this agenda could be full regarding other matters, most of all not related to the use of the time in a qualitative way.

This invites you to a question, when this agenda takes over and you become more like a “human doing” instead of a human being:

"Do I want to live the life of this busy agenda or be free to choose at least 20 minutes every day to experience the freedom of My agenda?"

The answer nobody can give you better than yourself, in an honest and direct way, making use of all your potentials and limitations regarding your time, your space and resources. 

If possible, making your practice happen right after every time you reflect upon this.

Enjoy your practice.
