title: When stillness has to be payed 
---
Black hole resorts, is one of the new concepts of health and wellbeing.

These resorts, sell the experience that while there, you can't access mobile phone, internet or television. 

Total disconnection - that may go beyond the 2000 Euros/night.

This value, "allows the privilege" of being in a place where there is no access to any of these devices. 

It acts like a detox, for those who can't - at home, take this decision by themselves in a conscious way. 

Disconnection, can be the fine line between losing or conquering autonomy on your everyday life. 

Loss or gain of empowerment, before the freedom that humans have - to embrace stillness by themselves - consciously, where ever they may roam.    

The world it's not lost, humanity either. 

There is only to be recovered the habit, by saying yes or no - to establish limits, to the most challenging human being on this planet - ourselves. 

Enjoy your practice.
