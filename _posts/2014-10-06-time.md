title:  Measuring the quality of space in your day

In 2003, during a visit to a museum in the city of Nanjing in China, I could observe three men selecting paintings for an exhibition that would happen later in that afternoon.

I was amazed by the selection process. It was quite fast and most of the times without words. Some nodding between them, or some sound was sufficient for a painting to be selected or not.

A few months later, I understood that it’s not about the fish, the nature scene or the historical personality that is painted. 

It’s about how the space is used and how it fuses with the whole.

Without being an expert, I guess this simplifies a lot of the process of choice.

At lest it looked so.

I found out, that this process, can be also accurate and helpful when looking back to my doings at end of a day.

Instead of remembering the things I’ve achieved, as a measure of how successful my day was, it’s easier - and more confronting too, if I just look for the quality of space and time in this day.

Sometimes, I can do it so fast as those Chinese juries.

What is the amount of this space and time in your daily Chi Kung practice?

+ Does stillness have a place in it?
+ Are your practice full of forms? Is it spontaneity allowed?
+ It’s more a doing or a being?

Enjoy your practice.
