As the day goes by, the tension accumulates in several parts of your body. This means that in the end of the day it's easy to carry all the tasks on "your shoulders" but also in your muscles.

Rebooting the muscles, may be one option between every task to keep you rested and leaving behind what is supposed to be left behind. 

[Some article about how the muscles accumulate tension](http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/split-keyboard/) during a writing session. 

Enjoy your practice and happy sky gazing.
