A traditional Tai Chi Form can take up to 30 minutes.

Some Chi Kung practices can take the student on a journey for more than an hour. 

Traditionally, Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung (站樁氣功) postures would be practiced for at least 40 minutes. 

So why would you invest your precious time everyday, sometimes more than once a day in this practices?

The entrance door for most of the students are the effects it brings. 

This effects can be speculated in a more physical or esoteric way. This can lead to never ending chats at the fireplace or in internet forums, just by the uselessness of trying to prove what that can only be perceived by regular and consistent practice. 

In the music world there is an expression: “Shut up and listen!” when things go far beyond the theoretical realm. 

I invite you to disconnect and ground yourself on your sacred space and forget all the promises and wonders that every system encloses. 

For the next 20, 30 or 40 minutes just “Shut up and practice!”

Enjoy.

P.s. - And please don’t tell anyone about this. In doing it you are wasting precious silence for what really matters.
