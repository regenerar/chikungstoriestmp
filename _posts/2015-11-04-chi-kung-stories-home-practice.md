This is the pilot episode of Chi Kung Stories Home Practice.

Basic sequence exploring the effortless way of training and how being in the posture is different from holding the posture.

Bringing this to your days, you may find out when you are tired that maybe you are holding a posture or a mindset instead of being in a posture or in the mindset. It&#8217;s Rigidity Vs Adaptability.

Enjoy or practice.
