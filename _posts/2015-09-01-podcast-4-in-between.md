Inspired by <a href="http://www.sustainablycreative.com" target="_blank">Michael Nobbs</a> tiny adventures, I decide to have my own during August.

In Between, it&#8217;s about the space between the digital 0 and 1 and how this leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius" target="_blank">Chinese Philosopher Mencius,</a> who wrote around 200 b.C. why &#8211; regarding to the nature of men, it&#8217;s so hard to return again to MS-DOS and mono-tasking.

Enjoy your practice.
