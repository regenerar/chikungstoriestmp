Since more then 20 journeys ago I elected Amsterdam as one of the most powerful places for developing my Chi Kung Training and one of my second homes in the planet besides Portugal. 

What attracts me here it's the combination between the sacred and the unholy. 

It's common to sense the smell of cannabis in almost every corner or you can find a Buddhist temple just in the vicinities of a coffee shop.

In the Red Light district one of the most truistic places in town, sex shops and churches from several religions live in what looks as a perfect harmony. 

But after all what does this has to do with the Practice?

I found out that if you can transform the contrasts and antagonisms in something nourishing, you can find your three square meters for your practice anywhere in the world. 

Enjoy your practice.
