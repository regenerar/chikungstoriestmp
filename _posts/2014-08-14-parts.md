title: The sum of all parts
---
In my teens Carl Sagan’s Cosmos was for me a window to knowledge otherwise difficult to access in the small village where I grew up.

In one of the episodes he gathers the main constituents of the human body and mix them all together. The result was dark and smoky water.

This is an example that what we are and do are far more then the sum of several parts.

When I think in my Chi Kung training I can see it as pieces that glue together designed to have a specific effect, or something more vast and wide which is not just the exercises but everything since the environment, the preparation, the food, mental state, season and many others.

The beauty of it is that when I relax and accept all this interferences and relations it’s more easy to feel supported and also healed by this practice and I guess also by life itself too.

To view for the first time or remember it - Carl Sagan’s video on chemical components.
