I invite you today for an exercise.

Just think in a place that you wouldn’t like to be right now.

+ Maybe stuck in the traffic.
+ Maybe doing something that you don’t like at work.
+ Maybe being in someones’s company that you don’t appreciate so much.
+ Maybe you have to be on a waiting line to fill and give out a form to someone.
+ Maybe on a job interview that will happen this week.
+ Maybe at the dentist.
+ Maybe at the hospital.
+ Maybe sick in your own bed.
+ Maybe in crowded places when you would prefer to be alone.
+ Maybe alone when you would enjoy to have someone by your side.

…

Although these could be the last places where you would like to be right now, if you find yourself in these environments you can give yourself a deep breath, a smile and discover that your Chi Kung practice can flourish in the most unlikely places.

Enjoy your practice.
