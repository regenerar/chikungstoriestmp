>"When it rained I would still go out and run. Because I didn't knew how many days the rain would last. I couldn't afford myself to the luxury that if the rain would last five days I wouldn't practice during all these days"  - A casual conversation with a retired professional runner.

The Chi Kung practice also faces rainy days.

+  You can get sick and it can last for two days, a week, or even more.
+  Friends and family come to visit you and stay under your roof, for an unexpected number of days .
+ The workload rises and you can't  predict when it will gonna slow down again.
+ Expected or unexpected travel, can disrupt the practice routine.
+ Physical or emotional trauma, can take away space and reduce in some cases drastically the time and resources that you have.

This events, like the rainy days, make it unpredictable when will be again space and time for your training.

When in doubt - practice.

Even if the time, space and resources are different from the usual ones.

Embrace the challenge of these days.

If you can overcome and endure the rainy days, when the sun shines again, your practice will be more strong and integrated, no matter what's the inner or outer  weather report.

Enjoy your practice.
