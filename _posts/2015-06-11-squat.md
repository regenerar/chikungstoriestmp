There is only one way to connect with Earth - by connecting to it - no bullshit or rhetorical mambo jumbo, just squat, sit, lay on the ground and feel beyond everything you knew before.

For a better experience - [please empty your cup at the door.](http://truecenterpublishing.com/zenstory/emptycup.html)

During 90 minutes, I filmed myself working with a box/squatting desk. This became a 90 second video of possibilities, that you can engage while on the floor working.      

If it is too hard, don't be too harsh - use your creativity with a pillow or a mat.

Enjoy your practice.
